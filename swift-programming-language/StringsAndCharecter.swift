//String Literals
//You can include predefined String values within your code as string literals. A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks (").
//
//Use a string literal as an initial value for a constant or variable:

let someString = "Some string literal value"


//Multiline String Literals
//let quotation = """
//The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin,
//please your Majesty?" he asked.
//
//"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on
//till you come to the end; then stop."
//"""

//Special Characters in String Literals

let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
// "Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Einstein
let dollarSign = "\u{24}"        // $,  Unicode scalar U+0024
let blackHeart = "\u{2665}"      // ‚ô•,  Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}" // üíñ, Unicode scalar U+1F496


//Initializing an Empty String
var emptyString = ""               // empty string literal
var anotherEmptyString = String()  // initializer syntax
// these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other


//for character in "Dog!üê∂" {
//    print(character)

let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "üê±"]

//print(catString)
// Prints "Cat!üê±"


//Concatenating Strings and Charactersin
//String values can be added together (or concatenated) with the addition operator (+) to create a new String value:

let string1 = "hello"
let string2 = " there"
var welcome = string1 + string2
// welcome now equals "hello there"

var instruction = "look over"
//instruction += string2
// instruction now equals "look over there"
let exclamationMark: Character = "!"
//welcome.append(exclamationMark)
// welcome now equals "hello there!"
